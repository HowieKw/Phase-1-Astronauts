# Phase-1-Astronauts

Phase 1 Astro will allow the user to select an image of an astronaut, then drag and drop it toward the target (a space station image perhaps).

The idea is for the user to bring an image of an astronaut into another image and pop-up a brief bio about the selected astro.

Bio should include

    1) Name

    2) Nationality

    3) Station

    4) Bio link to wiki
